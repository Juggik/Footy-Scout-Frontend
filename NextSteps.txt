-immediate steps: 
 
 -creation of the home page and link to it after sign in (start with nav bar and footer and have that consistent site wide)
-need to set it up so after sign we use that <link to > to go to the home page of the app 

- create a nav bar and footer thats consistent across all pages
-make a footer that is reusable across all pages
-need to set up authentication on the backend so thereafter all routes have it.
- need to figure out how to have a default style of default navbar thats reusable across all pages
-need to design the initial home page.
-figure out where apis are fired? there should be another file in sign-in-page for all the apis being fired i think?
-figure out the MUI stuff
-eventually ci/cd stuff for auto deployment
-bug on refreshing sign in page
