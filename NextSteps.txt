-immediate steps: how will that authorised thing be maintained across frontend all pages, so after signin all can use the token?
second bit is doing the auth across all backend routes set up.

- create a nav bar and footer thats consistent across all pages
-make a footer that is reusable across all pages
-need to set up authentication on the backend so thereafter all routes have it.
- need to figure out how to have a default style of default navbar thats reusable across all pages
-need to design the initial home page.
-figure out where apis are fired? there should be another file in sign-in-page for all the apis being fired i think?
-figure out the MUI stuff
-eventually ci/cd stuff for auto deployment
