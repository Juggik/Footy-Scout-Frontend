-immediate steps: 
 
 -https://www.football-data.org/documentation/quickstart - apis for home page use
 if you go to bottom theres an example to use the api to get top 10 scorers in a league,
 you can make a backend route that calls for all the leagues and does the sorting/counting to give a list of players with the top goals across all leagues)
 then the card should show the player name, goals scored, and the league their in and their team
 -can then use wiki image api to get the players photos each time.
 
 after home page make the page for when you actually click on a player that shows his stats last games, form etc,
 -then need to come back to home page and make a working search box that takes you to the player pages


 -finish player card, style colourscheme etc
 -identify which scnearios need navigate or which need link to or navlink copilot can tell you which scenario to use which

- create  footer thats consistent across all pages

-need to set up authentication on the backend so thereafter all routes have it.
- need to figure out how to have a default style of default navbar thats reusable across all pages
-need to design the initial home page.
-figure out where apis are fired? there should be another file in sign-in-page for all the apis being fired i think?
-figure out the MUI stuff
-eventually ci/cd stuff for auto deployment
-bug on refreshing sign in page
-make a contact page with a proper form in it so you can see how forms work in react"
