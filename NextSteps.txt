-immediate steps: 
-
-for the data returned from the backend, add a UUID for each row, 
index it on frontend, then need to pass the name into the url state 
and use that to obtain info for the page that shows when you click a player
-after that need search box on nav bar that also takes you to that same page but searches for the closest match to the player the user
typed in
can get the image from wiki

-for the tables use the emoji flags to show which league theyre in (just do top 5 only for ease)
-make the tile inside statCard as its own component
-need to sort out authentication on backend as right now seems like routes are exposed as no @jwt_required or whatever on the routes
 
 -https://www.football-data.org/documentation/quickstart - apis for home page use
 if you go to bottom theres an example to use the api to get top 10 scorers in a league,
 you can make a backend route that calls for all the leagues and does the sorting/counting to give a list of players with the top goals across all leagues)
 then the card should show the player name, goals scored, and the league their in and their team
 -can then use wiki image api to get the players photos each time.
 
 after home page make the page for when you actually click on a player that shows his stats last games, form etc,
 -then need to come back to home page and make a working search box that takes you to the player pages


 -finish player card, style colourscheme etc
 -identify which scnearios need navigate or which need link to or navlink copilot can tell you which scenario to use which

- create  footer thats consistent across all pages
-make a mouse thats nice like the see through black circle one that inverts colour
-add an animated shine effect on the player cards on home page

-need to set up authentication on the backend so thereafter all routes have it.
- need to figure out how to have a default style of default navbar thats reusable across all pages
-need to design the initial home page.
-figure out where apis are fired? there should be another file in sign-in-page for all the apis being fired i think?
-figure out the MUI stuff
-eventually ci/cd stuff for auto deployment
-bug on refreshing sign in page
-make a contact page with a proper form in it so you can see how forms work in react"
