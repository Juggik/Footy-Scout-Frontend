-immediate steps: 


-replacing ...loading with an actual loading animated component.
-need to make it so clicking on the player cards
also navigated to the player details page when you click the "click to find out more"
-need to turn off sign in page (first see if adding jwt required 
on each route makes it so you cant postman call them)
-need to fix refresh bug for home page
-center the search box on the navbar


-for the tables use the emoji flags to show which league theyre in (just do top 5 only for ease)
-need to sort out authentication on backend as right now seems like routes are exposed as no @jwt_required or whatever on the routes


-need to set up authentication on the backend so thereafter all routes have it.

-eventually ci/cd stuff for auto deployment
-bug on refreshing sign in page
-make a contact page with a proper form in it so you can see how forms work in react"
